# JriFTP_Client
This is the JriFTP Client, designed to be deployed in a snap. This is currently "Incomplete", and needs some work.

This client is designed to be deployale on platforms like [InfinityFree](https://infinityfree.com), and aims to stay that way. If you are making changes, try to keep within these parameters:

* HTML/CSS/JS/PHP Files must remain below 1 MB. Any bigger, and the files won't work
* Files should only contain the languages above
* Don't use Command-Line access, this doesn't exist
* Make the change worth it, don't make a change just because you don't like the fact a button is 2 pixels off and stuff like that.

These works aren't protected by a Copyright, do whatever the heck you want with them.
